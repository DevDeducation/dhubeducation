#### [Step 1: Choose A University](https://github.com/DevDeducation/dhub/blob/master/src/content/blog/How-to-apply-to-study-at-a-UK-university.md#step-1-choose-a-university)

The first step is to look for popular and high-ranking Universities in the UK that offer courses you are interested in. Here are some things to consider when applying:

* Location
* Employability/Graduate prospects
* Fees
* Entry requirements
* University Ranking

#### [Step 2: Preparations](https://github.com/DevDeducation/dhub/blob/master/src/content/blog/How-to-apply-to-study-at-a-UK-university.md#step-2-preparations)

Once you have narrowed down the search to your top five universities, the first step is to prepare necessary documents and forms. This includes school leaving certificates, exam results, the UCAS application form and a written Personal Statement, among other documents that may be required.

#### [Step 3: Submit UCAS Application](https://github.com/DevDeducation/dhub/blob/master/src/content/blog/How-to-apply-to-study-at-a-UK-university.md#step-3-submit-ucas-application)

The application process for UK universities differs from local universities as applications go through an organisation known as UCAS, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service. UCAS handles all admission applications to UK universities, including those submitted by international candidates like you.

To ensure a better chance of getting accepted, it is important that you prepare all the necessary documents and fill out all forms correctly. We also recommend that you apply for multiple universities simultaneously to ensure that you get your preferred offers. Read our [full guide on UCAS here](https://www.ucas.com/).
