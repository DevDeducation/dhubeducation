A Tuberculosis test is a visa requirement needed if you are applying for visa from Nigeria or West Africa and you will be staying in the UK for a period longer than six months.Â Although a tuberculosis test can be done in many hospitals in Nigeria, your test must be approved by the Home Office and you will need to obtain an IOM Medical Certificate confirming that you are free from TB before submitting a visa application. These apply to applicants such as long-term students, work permit holders, other employment and domestic workers, volunteer workers, (plus all dependents of the aforementioned), all settlement and marriage cases. There are only four (4) UK-approved tuberculosis test centers in Nigeria. In other words, a test result from a medical center aside from any of these four will not be recognized during your UK visa application

**Exceptions**

You do not need a certificate if you:

1. are a diplomatic passport holder travelling on official business or on a posting to the UK
2. qualify for an exempt visa
3. are applying for a certificate of entitlement

**Operating hours**

* Monday to Thursday: 8am to 5:30pm
* Friday: 8am to 12pm

**Available Locations**

Lagos and Abuja

**Test fees**

1. Payment must be made prior to the medical examination in Naira
2. the fee for TB screening is 63 British Pounds for persons aged 11 years and above and 60 US dollars for people aged 10 years and below

**Attending the clinic**

You should contact the above approved clinic to book an appointment. You should make it clear that you need the test for a UK visa application. You can expect to get an appointment within a few days of your request.

At busy times you may have to wait 10 days for an appointment, especially during the UK student visa peak season between June and September. We cannot arrange or prioritize appointments for you.

What you should bring with you:

1. Proof of identification, which contains your photograph, preferably your passport
2. A photocopy of your identification
3. Proof of payment of the test fee
4. UNHCR/MHA registration documents if you are a refugee applicant
5. If you have had TB in the past or have any other lung disease you should provide details of your previous screening and, If possible, your medical notes and x-ray results
