Swinburne University of Technology is a world-class university creating social and economic impacts through science, technology and innovation. Founded in 1908 by the Honourable George and Ethel Swinburne as the ‘Eastern Suburbs Technical College’, Swinburne has continued to evolve, gaining university status in 1992. 

Swinburne has [three campuses](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/life-at-swinburne/locations) located in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne — at Hawthorn, Croydon and Wantirna — offering tertiary education for higher education as well as Pathways and Vocational Education Training (VET). We also have a fourth campus in Sarawak, Malaysia. The [National Institute of Circus Arts](https://www.nica.com.au/) is located in Prahran, Melbourne and we also offer a range of qualifications online through [Swinburne Online](https://www.swinburneonline.edu.au/) and [Open Universities Australia](https://www.open.edu.au/). In 2019, we unveiled new locations in Sydney and Vietnam, each offering a small suite of sought-after Swinburne courses, and also opened an office in Nanjing, China — further connecting us to some of the fast-growing regions in the world.

As a dual-sector university, Swinburne offers higher education and Pathways and Vocational Education (PAVE). We offer courses in a broad range of disciplines and our close ties with industry provide students with opportunities for valuable workplace experiences during their studies. 

Swinburne researchers have a reputation for [high-quality research](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research) with particular strengths in astronomy, physics, engineering, materials science, computer science and information technology, design and innovation, health sciences, neurosciences and mental health. Underpinned by leading digital technology platforms, our researchers are [collaborating with industry](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/collaboration-partnerships) through embedded partnerships to drive innovation and create impact.
