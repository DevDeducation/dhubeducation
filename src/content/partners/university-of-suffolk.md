Through research and innovation, our national and international impact brings recognition and opportunity to the region supporting growth and development. 

The University of Suffolk is all about transformation — transforming individuals, our community, our region and beyond. Education, training and research are powerful tools to support transformation and change; we believe that by facilitating the development of skills, knowledge and behaviours, we will enable our students, our community and our region to be enriched, enhanced and impacted socially, culturally and economically.   

We are committed to putting students at the centre of our thinking, and the strong partnership between students and staff at the University is central to our ambitions. In a rapidly changing world, we have created a stable and supportive community where our students experience the highest quality in teaching, learning and social environments. Scholarships and high-impact research are ingrained within the institution, and we offer our students a transformational experience to prepare them for their future.
