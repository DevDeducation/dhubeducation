Every year, thousands of young people and adults from across the world pass through our doors.

Whether you want to train for a career or take the next step towards going to university, we have a wide range of courses all the way up to degree level at our campuses in Uxbridge and Hayes.

We also work with businesses to provide apprenticeships across many industries.

We have invested heavily in great teaching spaces, areas where you can work and share ideas with fellow students, and communal facilities to relax and enjoy a well-earned break between your studies.

College brings you a nurturing and supportive environment along with high-quality teaching to provide you with real-world skills. Our staff are professional teachers but also steeped in industry knowledge. Whichever subject you choose to study, you can be sure of being taught by people who share your passion.

Whether you want to study part-time to get that qualification you need to advance your career, or you’re leaving school and want to enjoy a more grown-up environment,  we’re here to meet your needs. There are even special courses to prepare returners to education for university entry. If you’re baffled by the range of qualifications on offer, we can help with that too.

The college has worked extremely closely with hundreds of businesses to ensure our training is relevant, rooted in the real world of employment, and responsive to the needs of the local economy.

Whether you come to us armed with lots of experience and qualifications or need to start from the beginning, our advisors will put you on the path to success.

Underpinning our success is the executive team and board of governors of HRUC – Harrow College, Richmond upon Thames College and Uxbridge College. The HRUC family consists of the three colleges, the West London Institute of Technology and HRUC Apprenticeships & Skills - who work closely with employers to support their training and workforce development needs.

Our facilities include:

Study areas, refectories, sports hall, gyms, a sixth from centre, restaurant, computer centres, student lounges and students’ union, clubs and societies.
