## What Makes Us Different

What really sets us apart from other universities is the guiding principle that future lawyers and business leaders should learn in a realistic, professional and contemporary context, with plenty of practical interactive engagement. That's why we keep our contact hours high and our teaching groups small.

## Our Heritage

We are the largest provider of legal education in the UK (HESA 2021/22). We can trace our origins to 1876 with the formation of tutorial firm Gibson & Weldon, and in 2016, we opened our leading Business School. With a rich heritage and a reputation for innovation and contemporary teaching practices, we continuously focus on developing the best legal and business minds. 

## Innovative and Contemporary Teaching Practices

All of our courses – from our undergraduate law degrees to our diverse range of business courses and postgraduate programmes – are designed with a unique, varied and innovative learning approach proven to deliver self-reliant professionals who can compete in the fast changing professional world. With a focus on developing skills in problem-solving, weighing up arguments, critical thinking and commercial awareness, our courses are designed to prepare you for the real-life challenges of the working world. 

## World Class Teaching

More than 250 of our lecturers are qualified lawyers and business professionals, and all have extensive practical experience which they are able to pass on to our students. We facilitate this process with high levels of student-to-lecturer contact time and small class sizes - one of the reasons that many firms insist their trainees study with us.

## Focused on Employability

We focus exclusively on practice-based training and give students access to our expert Careers and [Employability service](https://www.law.ac.uk/employability/services/?utm_source=Adwords\&utm_medium=other\&utm_campaign=TGM_PGLaw_GGL_PMax_MIX_Msc\&utm_ID=23993) database as soon as they accept a place with us. Students also benefit from our pioneering and award-winning pro bono programmes, which allow them to gain valuable work experience by helping real clients from the local community.
