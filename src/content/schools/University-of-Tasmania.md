A quiet pursuit of the extraordinary.

Our story began over 130 years ago, in a sandstone building overlooking Hobart. Since those early days, with three lecturers teaching eleven students, our purpose has remained the same. Through academic excellence, we make our home, and the world, a better place.

Here, success takes a certain determination and imagination. With our isolated location and small population, we have always had to work differently. It’s what makes Tasmanians such creative thinkers and problem solvers. And it has seen us generate powerful ideas both for and from our island.

Here, we nurture our environment as it nurtures us.

Just as the winds and elements shaped this land, this land shapes everything we do. That’s why, today, we fight to protect our island home. As a university, we study and preserve some of the last great wilderness on our planet. From our island shores, our research extends to the great Southern Ocean and down to the Antarctic.

Here, everything is connected.

Literature students ponder the vast Southern Ocean. Scientists sing. Doctors design. Teachers become entrepreneurs. Architects devote themselves to sheltering the needy.

Our creative minds capture our unique land and seascapes, reminding us why our island is worth fighting for. They tell stories that resonate far away. Our institutions lead in medical, agricultural, social and environmental research. Our small setting allows us to test big ideas, leading to greater outcomes for the world.

We welcome all enquiring minds, from near and far, to join our pursuit. Every one of our students becomes part of a welcoming, collaborative community. And our whole island becomes their campus.
